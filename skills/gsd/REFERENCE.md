# GSD Reference — load-on-demand payloads

Not needed at routing time. Load this file when the matching flow below fires (it sits next to `SKILL.md`; resolve the path per SKILL.md § Dynamic Sub-Skill Loading).

## spec.md — template & rules (Route 6 convergence)

```
# <feature>
## Context
<1-3 sentences: why this exists, current pain>
## Acceptance Criteria
- AC-1: <one verifiable outcome a reviewer can check in isolation>
- AC-2: <...>
```

Rules:
- Every AC is **checkable** ("endpoint returns 200 with `{ok:true}`", "user sees the badge") — never a task ("implement logging"). A reviewer reading only the AC knows how to confirm it.
- AC IDs are stable: `gsd-to-plan`/`gsd-verify` reference them. A spec revision re-issues fresh ACs and marks the replaced ones superseded.

## Milestones — large features

An ask that converges to many independently-shippable chunks (or would plan past ~10 tasks) is split at convergence: `.scratch/<feature>-m1/`, `-m2/`, … — each milestone a full spec→plan→verify→merge cycle landing on `<base>` before the next is specced in detail. Short-lived branches beat one giant plan; later milestones are specced against the merged reality, not a prediction. (`gsd-to-plan` enforces the same smell from its side: a plan pushing past ~10 tasks routes back here to split.)

## Feature cleanup — safe flow

"abandon/drop/delete feature X" → confirm name → read `<base>` from plan.toon → `git checkout <base>` (can't delete a branch you're on) → `git branch -d wip/<feature>` (safe delete; only `-D` after explicit force-confirm if unmerged) → `rm -rf .scratch/<feature>/`. If `git status --short` is dirty, warn before proceeding.
